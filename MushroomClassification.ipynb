Learn which features spell certain death and which are most palatable in this dataset of mushroom characteristics. And how certain can your model be?\n\n**Content**\n\nThis dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like \"leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.\n\n**Solution**\n\nIn this binary classification problem since the poisonus class is the positive class we aim to maximize recall since we want to avoid false negative, i.e. people getting poisoned by eating misclassiefied mushrooms.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1>Table of Contents<span class=\"tocSkip\"></span></h1>\n<div class=\"toc\"><ul class=\"toc-item\"><li><span><a href=\"#Preprocessing\"
